# Challenge Exercises

Now you've had an opportunity to get started using GitHub Copilot, we have a number of challenges for you to attempt. Remember the goal here is not to test your programming abilities but rather, see how you can use GitHub Copilot to help you complete these tasks. Even if you're not a developer, you may be surprised how Copilot can help you be successful with these challenge.

<summary>Challenge #1: Adding CRUD (Update) API endpoints from JSON data using GitHub Copilot</summary>

---

> To Update data from **"Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur"** to **"Wilayah Persekutuan"**

1. Open file: ```app.js```

2. At the file, scroll down to where you find the ```// TODO: Challenge #1``` comment

3. **Replace** the comment to provide context to GitHub Copilot to create a REST API endpoints to update data to the JSON file. Try adding the you own comment and press **ENTER** to generate a suggestion.

**Prompt Example:** ```// create a PUT request route in the Express server that update name based on ID from the "negeri.json" file and save the file ```

sample code:

```
app.put('/api/negeri/:id', (req, res) => {
    fs.readFile('negeri.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error reading file' });
            return;
        }

        const negeri = JSON.parse(data);
        const id = req.params.id;
        const name = req.body.name;

        const index = negeri.findIndex((state) => state.id === parseInt(id));
        if (index === -1) {
            res.status(404).json({ message: 'State not found' });
            return;
        }

        negeri[index].name = name;

        fs.writeFile('negeri.json', JSON.stringify(negeri, null, 2), (err) => {
            if (err) {
                res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error writing file' });
                return;
            }
            res.json({ message: 'State updated' });
        });
    });
});
```
